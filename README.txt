-nothing lol cause i created this project about an hour ago

    -Leaves and grass change color witht the turning of each skyblock season
    -In Autumn, particles will fall from multi-colored leaves

-Customizability
    -A setting that allows seasons to work everywhere or only in skyblock
    -A folder in resource packs which allows custom textures for seasons
-Essential
    -I want this to maybe be based off essential (wishful thinking probably lol)
-Compatibility
    -Kinda self explanatory, but I do feel that this should be considered a feature 'cause I've seen a decent chunk of mods that aren't compatible with even the most popular skyblock mods.
